# drupal-user-dashboard
Drupal dashboard powered by [dragula](https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula).

**This repository is under development.**

Current code has two regions (static css classes) where drag and drop of Drupal blocks is allowed.
The user can reararrange the blocks as he seems fit and this will be saved in to the browser [local storage](http://caniuse.com/#feat=namevalue-storage).
